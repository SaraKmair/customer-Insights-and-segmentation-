# customer-Insights-and-segmentation

In the project I worked on, I was tasked with using the provided data to create a preliminary set of customer segments. To address this request, I began with a descriptive analysis, focusing on key data points that I had identified. This analysis aimed to unveil essential trends within the dataset, providing insights into customer behavior and characteristics. Following the descriptive analysis, I delved into customer segmentation. I carefully outlined my analytical approach, highlighting key considerations and potential caveats to ensure the robustness of the segmentation process. The goal was to identify the most valuable customer segments, utilizing the proposed methodology. Once these segments were determined, I provided recommendations on how to leverage them effectively to optimize business strategies and enhance customer engagement.
